# Dining-Philosopher-Problem
This repository contains files for the Dining-Philosopher-Problem for course Comp-346 using Java

## Description of the problem

This project is a slightly extended version of the classical synchronization problem : THE DINING PHILOSOPHERS PROBLEM. The slight extension refers to the fact that sometimes philosophers would like to talk, but only one (any) philosopher can be talking at a time while they are not eating. A philosopher can only be talking for a limited amount of time, and while one philosopher is talking, none of the other philosophers can sleep; however they can be eating or thinking. The problem is solved using Monitor Synchronization Construct built on top of Java's synchronization primitives.
